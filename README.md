I'm a Product Manager and Software Engineer based in Sunny South Florida. Since the time of the World Wide Web becoming a reality I have had a passion to develop things that have a purpose and solve real world problems. I specialize in building and managing pharmacovigilance saftey monitoring solutions, payment solutions for B2B and B2C customers, and custom SaaS solution software from adult education management systems.

Over the years I have moved into product management, in addition to staying true to my love of software development. I have enjoyed this transition as it allows me the opportunity to design and shape the future of products I have worked on.

I have had the fortune to work with large companies in Transportation Management, Telecommunications, Mobile and PC Gaming, FinTech, as well as top 5 Pharmaceutical companies.

When I am not at the keys, you will find me traveling with my beautiful wife and our amazing German Shepard, cooking, or playing golf.
